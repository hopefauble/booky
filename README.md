# Welcome to Booky!

## Once you've cloned this repo, take these steps to set up the program:

### Front-end Setup

1. Open a new terminal, change the working directory to `frontend` and run `npm install`.
2. Run `ng serve` to begin the front-end development server.
3. The front-end server will run on localhost:4200.

### Back-end Setup

1. Open a new terminal, in the root directory run `npm install`.
2. You may need to download additional dependencies, such as sqlite3, cors. Sometimes standard npm install misses these.
3. The database should already be set up, and you can run `node app.mjs` to run the backend database. It will receive requests on port 3000.

After these steps have all been taken, you should be able to freely interact with the program on localhost:4200 in your web browser.
